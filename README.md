Code used to generate graphs for my OW competitive mode statistics article

Yes, I know the code is pretty garbage (I don't like this language but it's pretty much the best tool for the job) but it works and it's not like performance matters or this can be used for anything else.
That said, if you spot anything that makes the graphs inaccurate or something, please do tell me and I'll fix it.

If you want to use it:

First run the Brigitte filter. It filters out everyone who hasn't played Brigitte before the data was collected, so you can guarantee that they placed in season 9.

Then run the scripts in the folders that aren't named 'Graphs'. They'll all generate a file named FullList.json (one of them generates a file called SmallList.json as well). 

Just copy those files and drop them in the matching folder in 'Graphs' and run the scripts there. They should generate HTML files with the graphs in them.

The data you need can be found here:

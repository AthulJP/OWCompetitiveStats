# OWCompetitiveStats
Code used to generate graphs for my OW competitive mode statistics article

Yes, I know the code is pretty garbage (I don't like this language but it's pretty much the best tool for the job) but it works and it's not like performance matters or this can be used for anything else.
That said, if you spot anything that makes the graphs inaccurate or something, please do tell me and I'll fix it.
